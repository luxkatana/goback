# goback - Betere versie van wayback

## What is this project?

This project will be a copy of the wayback machine, but more simpler and basic.



## Requirements to run this project
- Python3
- an API key at appwrite (https://appwrite.io/)
- A storage bucket made within an appwrite project
- A host, that is accessible online
- A MySQL server
- Motivation to run this project


## Installation

1. Clone this project (the master branch is okay to be cloned I suppose)
2. Install the modules in requirements (run ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``)


Currently, I am spending a lot of time on the scraper.py, later, in the future, I expect to have a fully working version of this project where you can run the webserver, and let it run and just do the things it should do.

By far now, ``scraper.py`` can be runned directly using ``python3 scraper.py``, this will scrape a website and do some analysis.


You'll see development and many commits within this project, this is an IT project for computer class.
