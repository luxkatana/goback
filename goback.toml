media_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
#this is a very important configuration, "media_url" is the url that should be used to rewrite HTML assets in a document
# Set it to an accessible domain such as http://127.0.0.1 or mydomain.com, it must be accessible from outside
# change media_url to "http://127.0.0.1:8000" if you're running this in debug mode
# For example, if the requested webserver has the following HTML document:
# <!DOCTYPE html>
# <html>
# <body>
# <img src="https://somelinktoapicture.com"/>
# </body>
# </html>

# Goback will rewrite this document, and save it in appwrite as
# <!DOCTYPE html>
# <html>
# <body>
# <img src="{media_url}/media/<md5_hash>"/>
# </body>
# </html>
